This is one of the most common OOD interview questions and a must-know.

The interviewer will want to hear you discuss:

Payment Flexibility: How are customers able to pay at different points (i.e. either at the customer’s info console on each floor or at the exit) and by different methods (cash, credit, coupon)?
Capacity: How will the parking capacity of each lot be considered? What happens when a lot becomes full?
Vehicle Types: How will capacity be allocated for different parking spot types — e.g. motorcycles, compact cars, electric cars, handicap vehicles, etc.?
Pricing: How will pricing be handled? It should accommodate having different rates for each hour. For example, customers have to pay $4 for the first hour, $3.5 for the second and third hours, and $2.5 for all the remaining hours.
